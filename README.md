# ❤️ Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the presence of **heart disease** in patients using clinical data. The objective is to build a binary classification model that can identify at-risk individuals based on features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type.

The analysis was carried out in Python using tools like **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
